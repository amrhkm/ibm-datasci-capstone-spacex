# IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Analysis

## Introduction
SpaceX revolutionized the spaceflight industry by making affordable spacelight a reality. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, costing 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each. These cost savings are made possible primarily because the first stage of Falcon 9 can be reused. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information is valuable if a competing company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. This capstone aims to analyze past SpaceX launches that utilized Falcon 9 rocket to derive a better understanding of the different attributes of the launches and their relationship with the success of Falcon 9â€™s first stage to land through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive analysis to determine the outcome of the landing.

## Example of Succesful and Unsuccessful Landing of Falcon 9 First Stage

## Problems
- How the interaction between the different features of the launch would impact the success rate of a landing.
- What are the best-operating conditions that SpaceX has to achieve to ensure a successful landing?
