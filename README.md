# IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Analysis

## Introduction

In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. 
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each,these savings is possible mainly due to the first stage of Falcon 9 can be reused. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information is valuable if a competing company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. This capstone aims to analyze past SpaceX launches that utilized Falcon 9 rocket to derive a better understanding of the different attributes of the launches and their relationship with the success of Falcon 9â€™s first stage to land through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive analysis to determine the outcome of the landing.

## Example of Succesful and Failed Landing

### Failed landing

## Problems
- How the interaction between the different features of the launch that would impact the success rate of a landing.
- What is the best operating conditions that SpaceX has to achived to ensure a succesful landing?
